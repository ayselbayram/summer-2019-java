	 * 2 ways to achieve abstraction:
	 *      1-Abstract class
	 *      2-Interface
	 *      
	 * Why do we need interface?
	 *    you can implement as many interface as we want to the class, A class can implement multiple interfaces
	 *    A class can extend one class only
	 *    
	 * what we can have in interface?
	 *     methids: Abstract methods,static methods (static also belong to the interface),default method
	 *     variables: public, final,static===>given by automayically
	 *        varisable are public, static and final
	 *        
	 * what we can not have in interface?
	 *     constructor,
	 *     instance methods
	 *     instance variables
	 *     instance blocks
	 *     static blocks
	 *    
	 * 
	 * Interface: it is ablue print of class, but it is not a class
	 *     decleration of interface
	 *            public interface interfacename{
	 *                
	 *            }
	 *            
	 *           we can store abstract methods in the interface, and let classes implement abstract methods
	 *           interface is meant to be implemented
	 *  implements keyword; we use the implements keyword to implement abstract meyhods to the class
	 * 
	 * 
	 * interface we have used:
	 *       Webdriver
	 *       WebElement
	 *       
	 *       List
	 *       Set
	 *       Map
	 *       
	 *
