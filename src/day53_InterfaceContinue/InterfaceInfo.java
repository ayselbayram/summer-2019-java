	/*
	 * Interface: used for achieving abstraction
            we can store abstract methods
        Interface is meant to be implemented, cannot be final
        we can implement multiple interfaces to the class by implements keyword
       we can not override the abstract method in interface because averride is instance method.
            
    Interface Can Have:
            methods: abstract method, static method, default method
            variables: public static final ==> automatically
    Interface Can Not Have:
            Methods: Constructor, instance methods
            variables: instance variable
            blocks: static initializer block, instance initializer block
Restrictions of abstract method:
                    cannot have body
                    cannot have private and protected access modifiers 
                    cannot have static and final specifiers
                    MUST be created in abstract class or an Interface
        We can have  public access modifier for abstarct methids in inreface 
        but when we implement it to a class it mus have public access modifier
        public access modifier given public to all methods
