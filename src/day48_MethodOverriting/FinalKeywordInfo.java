	 *             variables:we can not reassign it
	 *                       instance variables and static variables must be assigned immideately
	 *                       we no need to assign the local variables  immideately when we give final keyword, 
	 *                       local variables can not be used before assign any value.
	 *                       local variable need to assigned befaore being used

	 *             methods: the implementation of the method can not be change.
	 *                      any method that final can not be override

	 *             classes; if the class has final, that class is not inheritable
	 *                      final class can Not be super class but can be sub-class
	 *                      final claesse are immutable, they can not be extended
	 *                      any class (except for abstract)can be final

	 * In java any method can be overload even Final keyword ones

	 * IQ=if you  have 4 variables, 2 final 2 private how many getter and setter we can generate
	 *       2 setter, we can not generate setter for final variable, final variables are constant
	 *       4 getter
